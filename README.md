## 📖 Game Story

Once upon a time there were some squirrels that mastered bird's food heist, cracked 3 squirrel-proof wild-bird feeders and lived happily ever after. Until... some youtuber, who became a bird watcher for illogical reasons, decided to make their life much worse by building a giant maze to test the squirrels' mental and physical limits.

Two of those squirrels were Slappy and her friend Skippy, who went to the grand squirrel for wisdom. He advised them to forget the life-supply of nuts and instead draw the perfect plan to rob the local bank in their area.

Follow their journey as they recruit new team members and become the most notorious animal thieves in the kingdom!
